I'm a data scientist (sometimes called chemist, sometimes even called physicist)
 working at the
 [Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion](http://www.cec.mpg.de/home.html?L=1).
My scientific interest includes molecular properties, vibrational and
 electronic structure as well as all things spectroscopic.

I'm also actively working as part of the
 [ORCA](http://www.cec.mpg.de/research/mts-forschungsprojekte/orca-dr-frank-wennmohs.html?L=1)-team
 on the development of quantum chemical software.

You'll find some of the tools I use explained here.
I also upload a few of my projects over at
[github](https://github.com/jdcapa).
